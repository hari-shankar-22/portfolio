<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing a supermarket sales dataset that contains extensive records of sales, profit, revenue,
taxes, customer information, and store details.
The primary goal is to gain insights into various aspects of sales, payment, tax, quantity, and profit. 
The analysis employs various visualizations, including total metrics, distribution analyses using pie charts, bar graphs, and 
a detailed table providing comprehensive information about products.
